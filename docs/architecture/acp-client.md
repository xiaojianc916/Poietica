# The ACP client

The client talks to a locally spawned agent process. The process is the
transport: the protocol runs as JSON-RPC over its standard input and output, so
there is no socket, no port, and no second protocol of our own invention.

## Ordering

Every session update is appended to the encrypted log, then applied to the
projections, then forwarded. Nothing observes an event that a restart would
make disappear.

## Failures are not protocol errors

A handler that cannot write to the store does not answer the agent with a
JSON-RPC error. Our storage failing is not the agent's fault, and telling it
otherwise invites it to react to a fault it cannot fix. The failure is kept on
the recorder and raised by the driver once the turn ends, so the turn only
counts as successful if everything about it was durable.

## Permissions default to refusal

Until a surface exists for asking the user, permission requests are refused
automatically, using one of the agent's own refusal options so that a refusal
is distinguishable from an abandoned turn. Both the request and the answer are
written to the log.

## What the projections deliberately ignore

The update enum grows with the protocol and its variants are not exhaustive.
Unrecognised updates and unrecognised tool states are logged verbatim but left
out of the projections rather than guessed at. Since the projections are
rebuildable from the log, a later version can backfill them.
